This repo is for sharing Jenkinsfile idea's.

- To be identified by IDE or vim, Jenkinsfile should be started with :
  #!groovy
- Jenkinsfile should be checkedout from SCM (git)
- All developers can see the build pipeline code and suggest for improvement
- No more using the Jenkins UI
- Scalable and simple
- utils.groovy is a library file that can be imported to the job
  - generic functions can be shared and unified among all jobs
  - easy to maintain and expand
